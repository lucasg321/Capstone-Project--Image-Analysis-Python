# Capstone-Project--Image-Analysis-Python
Image analysis via Python with OpenCV and numpy

Similar to the first capstone repository, however, this is written in python instead of using C# and EmguCV. Some functions are slightly different, in the python version I used the inRange fucntion to find like colors. This will allow us to test which verison, C# or Python, is faster and/or which version works better.
